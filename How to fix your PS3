What Youâ€™ll Need:
A USB flash drive (at least 1GB for the update file).

A computer with internet access.

Your PS3

A working FAT32 or exFAT formatted USB drive (this is important).

**Step-by-Step Fix:**
1. **Format the USB drive properly**
Insert the USB into your computer.

Right-click it > Click Format.

Choose FAT32 or exFAT as the file system.

Click Start to format.

2. **Create the correct folder path**
On the USB drive, make a folder named PS3 (must be all caps).

Inside the PS3 folder, create another folder named UPDATE (also all caps).

Your folder path should now be:
USB drive > PS3 > UPDATE

3. **Download the correct file**
Go to the official PlayStation website:
**https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/install-system-software/**

Scroll down to "Reinstall System Software" and download the bigger file (around 1 GB).

The file will be named something like PS3UPDATE.PUP.

4. **Put the file in the right folder**
Move the downloaded PS3UPDATE.PUP file into the UPDATE folder you created.

Final path should be:
USB drive > PS3 > UPDATE > PS3UPDATE.PUP

5. **Plug the USB into the PS3**
Turn off the PS3 completely (not Rest Mode).

Plug the USB drive into one of the front USB ports.

Press and hold the PS3's power button until you hear a second beep (7 seconds total). This puts the PS4 in Safe Mode.

6. **Reinstall system software**
In Safe Mode, select option 7: Reinstall System Software.

Follow the on-screen instructions.

The PS4 will format the drive and install a fresh system software.

# Tips:
Make sure the file is named exactly PS3UPDATE.PUP (all caps, no extra characters).

If your PS4 can't find the file, double-check the folder structure and formatting.
